NTNU Honesty Declaration
------------------------


I 陳建豪, 60875002H hereby submit my material for assessment.
I have worked together in a group with:
  1.) 沈方靖 60875001H


I certify that the following material submitted for evaluation in my course work 
is my own work, except for material listed in the section 'External Sources' below.


You are allowed to freely discuss the assignment with your classmates as long as the
discussion is limited to what could reasonably be exchanged on a whiteboard or notepad. 
If you exchange more information, then you must specify this in the 'External Section' below.


In particular, I certify that with the exception of material listed in the section
'External Sources' below:


  1.) I have implemented the program by myself
  2.) I have run the tests and experiments by myself and the results were as 
      described in my report.
  3.) I have written the report describing my design, work, experiments by myself.


External Sources
----------------
You are allowed to use external sources to complete your assignment without 
disciplinary penalty as long as they are mentioned in this section.


Some example entries may be:
   I copied the part of my program that reads in the input from Jacky Baltes
   I found a description of the GCD algorithm at http://www.teachmath.com/ and used it 
      for the design of my program
   I used the opencv library and its documentation for http://www.opencv.org


List ALL sources of information that you used in this work.


1.) Lecture slides by Jacky Baltes

2.) I implemented the program with OpenAI Gym library and its official page
    for https://gym.openai.com/

3.) I build the environment by modifying "Acrobot-v1" from OpenAI Gym library.
    Link: https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1/

4.) I used the PyTorch library and its documentation for https://pytorch.org

5.) I found a example implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm at PyTorch GitHub
    repository and used it for the design of my program.
    Link: https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/reinforcement_learning/reinforce.py

6.) I found a example implementation of the Actor-Critic algorithm at PyTorch GitHub
    repository and used it for the design of my program.
    Link: https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/reinforcement_learning/actor_critic.py

7.) I used the matplotlib library to plot the result graph and its documentation for
    https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/index.html
    
8.) I used argparse library to build the command line interface for my program and
    its documentation for https://docs.python.org/zh-tw/3/howto/argparse.html
